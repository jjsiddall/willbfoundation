                <h1>About Will </h1>
                <p>
                    In 1999, when Will and his twin sister, Alexis, were born, there was no newborn screening for Cystic Fibrosis (CF), so Will went many years without being treated for his disease. Will was (finally) given a test and just before he turned 10, Will was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis.  Not long after Will found out he had CF; Will asked his parents if he could start a charity to help cure the disease.  Inspired by how Will reacted to having CF, along with his heartfelt request, <em>The Will B Foundation</em> was created.

                            <h2>CF</h2>
                            <p>
                                Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. This disease is a rare disease affecting about 30,000 children and adults in the United States. Will’s cells produce thick and sticky mucus that can make him susceptible to lung infections and complicate the way he digests his food.  For a couple of hours each day, Will inhales several medicines through a nebulizer and completes breathing exercises that help keep his lungs clear. <a href="http://www.cff.org/">Learn More &raquo;</a></p>
