                <blockquote>
                    <p>It'd be easy for Will to spout excuses and decide there's so much he just can't do. After all, he has cystic fibrosis. Just breathing can be difficult for him, and maintaining his weight is a challenge.</p>
                    <p>But that's not how Will sees things.</p> 
                    <p>Will sees his hourlong treatments that clear mucus from his lungs and digestive system each morning and night as a pathway to being a top student and playing basketball, volleyball, baseball and golf.<p>
                    <br>
                    <p>He sees his cystic fibrosis not as a disease that will keep him from life, but as a chance to help others live a better life.</p>

                                Will and his family run a foundation that aims to raise money for organizations that research treatments and seek to cure CF. The Will B Foundation -- which was Will's idea -- is supporting the CF Center at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
